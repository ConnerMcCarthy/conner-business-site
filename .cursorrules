Project: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

Architecture rules:
- Use Server Components by default (NO "use client" unless needed).
- Only use "use client" when the component uses: useState/useEffect, event handlers, browser-only APIs, or context that requires client.
- Keep pages/layouts in /app. Put reusable UI in /app/components or /components.
- Prefer composable components; avoid huge single files.
- Do not add new libraries unless I ask.
- Use Tailwind utility classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessibility (labels, aria where needed).
- When you change code, explain what you changed and why.

Coding style:
- TypeScript strict-friendly code.
- Use named exports for components unless otherwise needed.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops.
